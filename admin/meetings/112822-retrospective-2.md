## Retrospective Meeting #2

_For our second retrospective meeting we decided to continue following the Mad/Sad/Glad template from the assignment video because we found it very helpful in facilitating open communication regarding the highs and lows of the past sprint. However, to make communication more open and to further promote the pychological safety of all team members, we decided to have each team member type their Mad/Sad/Glad responses in an anonymized fashion. This way we could all discuss and review on everyone's responses as a general whole in an open and inclusive way.  Each team member wrote about what they were mad, glad, and sad about from the last sprint so we could then reflect on our work as a team and plan our next steps accordingly!_
